Neural Networks for Data Science Applications: Saliency Maps Interpretability

## Description
This project explores the interpretability of neural networks in the context of data science applications, focusing on the use of Saliency Maps to understand model predictions.

## Saliency Maps
Saliency Maps provide insights into which features or parts of an input contribute most to a neural network's output. In this project, we leverage Saliency Maps to enhance the interpretability of our models.
